<font size=5>Client behavior</font>
<hr>

<h3>Common options</h3>

<dl><dt><b>
Log output of clients
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
You can save command-line by GUI and output from the client. 
This log is useful, when you get an error, 
or if you want to use the PAR client on Command Prompt. 
The log file is "<tt>MultiPar.log</tt>" in "<tt>save</tt>" folder. 
The folder can be opened by double-clicking status text on Creating or Verify window. 
If the log file becomes too large, next output is saved in another file "<tt>MultiPar.#.log</tt>". 
When you don't need those log files anymore, delete them by yourself.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><b>
Clear log
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
When you want to delete all log files at once, push this button.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><b>
Run clients with lower priority
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
When the response of PC to your control becomes too slow, while MultiPar is running, 
you may check this option. 
This is useful to run MultiPar in background, while you do another task on the same PC.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><b>
Don't wait finish of other tasks
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
Only when you want to run multiple instances' tasks at the same time, 
check this option. 
Because each creating or repairing task consumes PC resource exclusively, 
total speed may happen to be slower than queued tasks.
</dd></dl>

<hr>

<h3>Creation options</h3>

<dl><dt><b>
Format of recovery files
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
You can change the version of newly creating PAR files. 
You should use "<b>PAR 2.0</b>" normally. 
You may use "<b>PAR 1.0</b>", only when source files are almost same size.
<!--You may use PAR 3.0 only when you are not satisfied with PAR 2.0 format.-->
<!--Currently "<b>PAR 3.0</b>" is available only for testing purpose of new technology. 
If you want to test old sample PAR3 files, 
you move "<tt>par3j_old.exe</tt>" from "<tt>tool</tt>" folder to the parent folder, 
and rename it to "<tt>par3j.exe</tt>".-->
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><b>
Range of redundancy
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
You can change the range of redundancy slider-bar on Create window. 
This may be useful, if you want to set small or large redundancy mostly. 
Even when the range is limited, you can set more redundancy by typing number of recovery blocks directly.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><b>
Always use folder name for base filename
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
Unless you type the filename by yourself, 
"Base Filename" is set automatically after you select source files at first. 
The method of naming is same as QuickPar like; 
(1) When there is only one source file, the filename is used. 
(2) When there are multiple source files, the preceding common part of filenames is used. 
(3) Else, the folder name of parent directory is used. 
If you want to use the last naming method always, 
check this option.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><b>
Don't search subfolders
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
When a folder includes subfolders, 
all files in each folder are searched recursively by default. 
If you want to ignore subfolders, check this option. 
Even when it's checked, you can add inner files manually.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><b>
Don't create index file
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
Index file is the smallest PAR file, which does not contain any recovery blocks. 
It is available to verify source files, but is useless to recover a damage. 
If you don't need the file, check this option.
</dd></dl>

<hr>

<h3>Verification and Repair options</h3>

<dl><dt><b>
Monitor files to verify
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
If you check this option, 
MultiPar will monitor recovery files and source files after the first verification. 
When new files are added or some files are modified, they are verified automatically. 
After when a previous verification was ended by error, all files were complete, 
or all files were repaired successfully, monitoring will finish. 
If you want to cancel monitoring at any time, push "<b>Escape-key</b>". 
After that, you may click "Verify" button or push "F5-key" to start monitoring again.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><b>
Repair automatically
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
If you check this option, MultiPar will start repair after verification if possible. 
When this isn't checked, it does verification only. 
If you are lazy to click "Repair" button everytime, this may be useful. 
The setting is enabled for all verification by "F5-key", "Add", or "Monitor". 
Even when some files might be restored, if it is impossible to repair all files, 
it won't repair at all.
</dd></dl>

<a name="verification_level"></a>
<dl><dt><b>
Verification level
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
Normally "<b>Detailed verification</b>" is good. 
"<b>Simple verification</b>" is faster, when damage didn't delete or insert bytes. 
"<b>Additional verification</b>" will check all files in the base directory. 
When filenames of damaged files are different, 
or when source files are contained in a non-compressed archive like ISO-image, 
select "Additional verification" to add them automatically. 
"<b>Aligned verification</b>" is the fastest, but it doesn't backup damaged files. 
Because it will over-write damaged file directly, there is a risk of more data loss at failed recovery.
</dd></dl>

<a name="reuse_result"></a>
<dl><dt><b>
Re-use verification result
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
If you want to skip some part of verification at next time, set some period in this option. 
When you open a recovery file at first, files are verified automatically and the result is saved. 
When you push "Repair" buttom afterwards, 
the result is re-used and most part of actual verification will be skipped, 
then the speed becomes faster. 
By default setting (<b>For a time</b>), GUI keeps the result until it is closed. 
When you set a longer period (<b>For some days</b>), GUI keeps the result for the period. 
<b>Caution !</b> with this setting you may see the <b>past status</b> of files. 
If you want to see the <b>current status</b> of files, push "<b>F5-key</b>", 
then all files will be re-verified newly. 
The data files are "<tt>***.bin</tt>" or "<tt>***.ini</tt>" in "<tt>save</tt>" folder. 
Though old results beyond the period are erased, 
sometimes those files may become many and large, 
then be careful about setting long period.
</dd></dl>

</table></center>
</p>

<dl><dt><b>
Don't search subfolders
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
When a file is missing, it will search the misnamed or moved file in folders recursively by default. 
If you want to ignore subfolders by the reason of taking time, check this option.
</dd></dl>

<hr>

<h3>PAR2 options</h3>

<dl><dt><b>
Save UTF-16 filename additionally
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
MultiPar supports "Unicode Filename packet" (UTF-16 filename) in PAR 2.0 specifications. 
Only when you use non-ASCII characters in filename, 
and you send PAR2 files to someone who has another PAR2 client which supports the packet, 
you should check this option. 
Usually it is worthless, because most PAR2 clients ignore the packet. 
No need to check this for MultiPar and par2_tbb, which use UTF-8 filename.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><b>
Use file index for volume number
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
Standard PAR2 filenames contain how many recovery blocks as their volume number. 
If you want to use index of files instead of number of blocks, check this option. 
When you transport PAR2 files over UseNet, you must not check this, 
because the number of blocks is important for downloaders.
</dd></dl>

<a name="packet_repetition"></a>
<dl><dt><b>
Packet repetition
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
When you create many recovery blocks, the PAR2 files may have many repeating packets. 
You can disable or decrease the repetition of packets. 
If you want smaller PAR2 files, 
you may select "<b>Not used</b>" (no repetition) or "<b>Upto # times</b>" (packets will be repeated upto # times.). 
If you create only one recovery file, you should select "<b>No restriction</b>".
</dd></dl>

<h3>PAR3 options</h3>

<p>&nbsp
My sample PAR3 is implemented only for personal testing purpose. 
Because I modify its algorithm and format sometimes while writing the proposal, 
current samples won't be compatible with future PAR 3.0 specifications. 
This section would be obsolete in future versions.
</p>

<dl><dt><b>
Create PAR 2.0 compatible PAR3 file
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
If you want to create PAR3 files which enables verification by PAR2 client, check this option. 
PAR2 client like QuickPar can use those PAR3 files for verification. 
Because PAR3 recovery data is not compatible for PAR2, 
PAR2 client cannot recover lost files with PAR3 files.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><b>
Use incomplete recovery
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
Only when you cannot repair files by the lack of recovery blocks, 
you may try this option. 
This method retrieves damaged blocks from corrupt files, 
and tries to repair them as possible as it can. 
For setting, low value will read more damaged blocks and slow, 
and high value will read less damaged blocks and fast. 
When "Delete damaged files after Reapir" option isn't checked, 
if the repair is failed, "<tt>.incomplete</tt>" is inserted into filename and lost area is filled by zero.
