<h3>Integration</h3>

<dl><dt><b>
Associate with ... files
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
You can associate MultiPar with these file types. 
Their extensions are PAR1 (<tt>.PAR</tt>, <tt>.P01</tt>, <tt>.P02</tt>, <tt>.P03</tt>, <tt>.P04</tt>, <tt>.P05</tt>, <tt>.P06</tt>, <tt>.P07</tt>, <tt>.P08</tt>, <tt>.P09</tt>), 
PAR2 (<tt>.PAR2</tt>), PAR3 (<tt>.PA3</tt>), and SFV/MD5 (<tt>.SFV</tt> and <tt>.MD5</tt>). 
Before you check one of them, you should de-associate it from another application (like QuickPar).

<a name="shortcut"></a>
<dl><dt><b>
Integrate MultiPar into Shell
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
This option adds <b>MultiPar</b> on right-click menu over <b>Windows Explorer</b>. 
On the sub-menu, you click "<b>Create Recovery Files</b>" to create PAR files, 
or click "<b>Verify Recovery File</b>" to verify files by the PAR file. 
However this feature is similar to shortcut icon in [SendTo], 
you can supply more files, because there is no limit of length as command line. 
When only one folder is selected to create, the folder becomes base directory, 
and all files in the folder will be selected. 
When <a href="http://www.7-zip.org">7-Zip</a> is installed, it's possible to pack files, and create PAR files for the archive.
</dd></dl>

<hr>

<h3>Program Shortcut</h3>
<p>&nbsp
Shortcut icon on desktop or [<b>SendTo</b>] menu is usable to start MultiPar for invoking Open or Create. 
If you drop down a recovery file on the shortcut icon, 
MultiPar will open the recovery file. 
If you drop down some source files on the shortcut icon, 
MultiPar will create recovery files for them.

<h3>Folder location</h3>
<p>&nbsp
By pushing these buttons, you can open MultiPar related folders directly. 
Though this feature is useful to refer documents, be careful not to delete important files. 
The current user's temporary files and log files are saved in the user specific "<tt>save</tt>" folder, 
and it is possible to erase those files in this folder anytime.

<h3>Hardware environment</h3>

<dl><dt><b>
Memory usage upto around
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
This option is not strict, but a rough rate against available memory size. 
"<b>Auto</b>" is good normally. 
Only when you want to keep memory for other applications or system cache, 
you may try lower rate.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><b>
File access mode
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
Only when MultiPar fails to recognize a drive type, you may change this option. 
To enforce random access mode on the drive (SSD or RAM drive), select "<b>SSD</b>". 
To enforce sequential scan mode on the drive (HDD or Optical drive), select "<b>HDD</b>". 
Because random access mode is very slow (and maybe harmful) on HDD, 
you should select "<b>Auto</b>" normally.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><b>
CPU usage
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
If you have recent PC with Multi-Core CPU, you may change the usage rate. 
When you want to keep some CPU power for another task or cool down PC, this is useful.

Extra feature
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
The proper features are selected from checked items. 
Only when a feature doesn't work correctly, remove the check.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt><b>
Enable GPU acceleration
</b></dt><dd>&nbsp
When your PC includes a GPU device, you may check this option for speed-up. 
If OS's response is too slow or PC is over heat, you should disable it.
