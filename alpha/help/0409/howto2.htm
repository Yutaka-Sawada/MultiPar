<h3>Whether to change block allocation</h3>
<p>&nbsp
If you have set options in <a href="option2.htm#unit_size">"GUI options" page</a> properly, 
no need to change, because efficient blocks are allocated automatically. 
Only when you feel the number of blocks are too many or too few, you may adjust manually. 
When you are using a slow PC or want to create quickly, it may be good to decrease the number of blocks. 
If you know how many blocks are acceptable for speed, 
you would better limit up to the block count at <a href="option2.htm#block_allocation">"Block allocating method"</a>.
